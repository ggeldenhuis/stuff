The idea of this script is to have an easy way to populate a cobbler server.
It also allows you to template information ensuring less mistakes.


You might well argue that this is a duplication of what cobbler does already
and you would be right. Why don't I just use cobbler templates? The honest 
reason was that where it was needed it was just easier to write this than 
try to template a non-standard environment. That being said I think it is 
still usefull and it gives you a way to version control server config. You
could have a scenario where you update the config. A git/svn trigger is 
called which updates the cobbler server and you are thus assured of an up
to date cobbler server should you then need to rebuild a server. Off course 
this does not take care of the actual updating of the machine.

Another possible advantage which is something that we were looking at is to
use the yaml files as a lightweight CMDB. We can thus use it as a source for
hiera which in turn gets read by puppet. So if puppet needs to set settings
it uses the same config files as does cobbler.

If I am really honest this would all just be a nice python exersize, so use
it don't use it. If you like it drop me an email, if you don't like it 
tell me why and suggest an improvement or a different point of view.
